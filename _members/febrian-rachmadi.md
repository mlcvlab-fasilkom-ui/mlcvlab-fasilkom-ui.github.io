I am a faculty member of the Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia. I am also affiliated as a visiting research scientist at [Brain Image Analysis (BIA) Unit](http://bia.riken.jp/), [RIKEN Center of Brain Science (RIKEN CBS)](https://cbs.riken.jp/en/), Wako, Japan working together with [Dr. Henrik Skibbe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sQyGf94AAAAJ), the team leader of the BIA Unit to develop machine/deep learning techniques for processing and analyzing marmoset brain image data (neuroscience). Furthermore, I also hold an honorary fellowship based in the Deanery of Clinical Sciences in the College of Medicine & Veterinary Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, which allows me to collaborate closely with the [Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences (CCBS)](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences). My main interests are medical image and data analysis/computation using data-driven methods, such as deep learning algorithms. 

I did my PhD and MSc studies at the [School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics), supervised by [Prof. Taku Komura](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/taku) and co-supervised by [Dr. Maria Valdés Hernández](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/maria-valdes-hernandez(f22f22d9-52bb-4883-bf94-52aa23a691e1).html). At that time, I was affiliated with the [Computer Graphics and Visualisation (CGVU)](http://www.ipab.inf.ed.ac.uk/cgvu/index.html) research group in the [Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour (IPAB)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ipab) (School of Informatics) and [Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences (CCBS)](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences). My PhD thesis is titled **"Development of machine learning schemes for segmentation, characterisation, and evolution prediciton of white matter hyperintensities in structural brain MRI"** and examined by [Prof. Emanuale Trucco](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AoqaZGkAAAAJ&hl=en) from the University of Dundee (external examiner) and [Dr. Mohsen Khadem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=EdlB5Q8AAAAJ) from the University of Edinburgh (internal examiner).
